<p>
Hey, my name is Evan and I am pursuing a computer engineering degree at the University of South Carolina.

    <p>
      The diagram has 5 sections. The problem and solution sections are probably the most important with the other three sections
      being details that come from the problem and solution. The main idea for a solution is some type of app that allows students
      to make and join different groups for studying or extracurricular activities.
